Testing, testing...

Umm...
Hi!

I'm Janmeeba, just a random Finnish gamer boy who is dreaming of becoming a game developer in the future.
Currently i'm studying programming in a local upper secondary school... and of course studying other things at the same time, too.

Awkward line break... ._.

I don't have much social skills, instead i have got a diagnosed Asperger and ADD, and yes, a social personality. It makes life hard.
On the other hand i have also got a great sense of humour and thus i like to sometimes torture myself with some self-derogatory humour.
Although what i have heard is that that is something Swedish people would do. And i'm Finnish. But it's okay because my name Jan seems to be more Swedish than Finnish. O_o And besides, i love Sweden. As much as i love Finland(okay, maybe just a little less because of course i love my home country more <3).

Aaanyways, i'm a weird person. Which can be noticed in many ways, in many places. But i'll leave that for the interested people to find out by themselves... it won't be a hard task anyways. ¬_¬

I hope i will get some ideas to work on, soon. I want to make games at some point and i'm aware of the fact that to make games one must have ideas first. I have always been lacking ideas. In every possible way. SIGH... well, at least there shouldn't be any risks of getting bored as i have also got a lot to learn in programming, so that will keep me "entertained" for a while. 8)

Well, maybe this is a long enough introduction or Hello World or Readme or... whatever. By the way, i was born in 1995 and i will very soon turn 20! Yay. :D Achievement unlocked: Create a GitHub account six days before your 20th(or actually i guess it's 21st since i'm turning 20...) birthday, during the last hour of the night, less than hour until morning, when you actually should have been sleeping for many hours already(hmm... seems like i have already learned the most important aspect of being a programmer, huh?)... Here, have some free proofs(okay, it's just one screenshot... but maybe it includes more than one proof? Okay, Jan, don't go into philosophical thinking now; this is not the right place or time for that...): http://puu.sh/gsCG1/7fdd5c1831.jpg I should probably break this line here already.

Funny fact: if i remember right, if that link won't be visited for 30 days, that proof will disappear from there and the screenshot will be deleted automatically. Another funny fact(for me, possibly not for you): i will still have the proof locally as my Puush screenshots get saved on my school laptop automatically. \m/

Okay, really, enough talking for now. I should commit this change. :/
